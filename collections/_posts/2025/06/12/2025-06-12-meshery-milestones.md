Open source thrives on community. Every pull request, tutorial, or design you create contributes to the project's success and it doesn't go unnoticed. That's why the Meshery community built the [meshery/meshery-milestone](https://hub.docker.com/r/meshery/meshery-milestone) Docker image: a simple web app designed to recognize your milestones.

With this Docker image, you can easily spin up the milestone application, visually celebrate your accomplishments, and let everyone know about your contributions to Meshery's projects. 
<!-- write a longer introduction, don't break user readibility/flow  -->

## 1. Installing the Meshery Milestones Image

You'll find the image under <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/meshery/meshery-milestone">meshery/meshery-milestone</a>, maintained by the Meshery community.

It's a simple app to encourage and recognize the milestones of Meshery users and contributors.

#### 1. Download the image
```
docker pull meshery/meshery-milestone
```

#### 2. Start the container
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 meshery/meshery-milestone
```

Then open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```
You‚Äôll land on a warm ‚ÄúCongratulations!‚Äù screen inviting you to claim your badge.
